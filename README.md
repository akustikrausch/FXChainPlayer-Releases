## Why VST3 in an audio player?

More reasons than you'd expect.

- **🎧 Headphone surround & spatial audio** — Run binauralizers like **dearVR MONITOR**, **Waves Nx**, or **Dolby Atmos Production Suite** to turn stereo into a full spatial soundstage on any pair of headphones. No system-wide wrapper, no virtual audio cable.
- **🎚️ Headphone calibration & correction** — Use frequency-response plugins like **Sonarworks SoundID Reference**, **Beyerdynamic Headphone Lab**, **Waves Nx Virtual Mix Room**, or **Morphit** to flatten your specific headphone model to a neutral reference.
- **📻 Internet radio & streaming cleanup** — Load a compressor, EQ, de-esser, or multiband processor on poorly-mastered streams or dynamic-range-compressed "loudness war" tracks to tame them while you listen.
- **🔌 Plugin auditioning** — Want to hear how that new reverb, saturator, or tape emulation sounds on real music? Drop it in. No DAW boot-up, no empty session, no audio import.
- **🔊 Loudness normalization & limiting** — Keep playback levels consistent across tracks from wildly different sources (old CDs vs. modern streaming).
- **🏠 Room correction** — Apply convolution IRs or parametric EQ profiles to compensate for your listening room and speaker setup.
- **🅰️🅱️ A/B plugin comparison** — Quickly toggle effects in and out on familiar reference tracks to hear exactly how they color the sound.
- **♿ Accessibility** — Hearing aid profiles, frequency boosting, dynamic range compression, or custom EQ curves for listeners who need tailored audio processing.
- **🎛️ Mix referencing** — Drop your mix in, compare A/B against a reference master, hear your monitor chain on someone else's material.
- **🎚️ Per-channel chains for trackers, SIDs, multi-channel chiptunes** — Each channel of a `.mod` / `.xm` / `.it` / SID / NSF file gets its OWN VST3 chain. Reverb only on channel 1, LP filter only on the bass channel, distortion only on the lead. Configure once per file (CRC32-keyed auto-load), bake into the export.
- **💾 Bake the effect chain into a file** — render any track or the whole playlist through the VST chain to WAV / MP3 / FLAC / OGG, faster than real-time. Take your processed audio anywhere. [Details below](#export-through-your-vst3-chain).

Up to **16 VST3 plugins in a serial chain** (was 8 pre-v0.45.0). Drag-and-drop reorder. Per-slot bypass and dry/wet. Smooth global chain mix. Native plugin GUIs. Everything runs at **64-bit double precision** end-to-end.

## DJ Mode — beta

Press `D` (or click the DJ button in the status bar) to switch to a **dual-deck DJ console** built into the player. Drop tracks on Deck A and Deck B, mix with a real crossfader, and use everything you'd expect from a DJ rig.

- **Two decks side by side**, each with: per-deck waveform (overview + 10-second close-up), title / artist / BPM / Key / Camelot, 8 hot cues (numbered, persisted in SQLite, set / clear / colour-coded), Loop In/Out + Reloop, auto-loop chips (1/8 1/4 1/2 1 2 4 8 beats), beat-jump (`<<` `<` `>` `>>`), 3-band EQ (LO / MID / HI knobs, ±12 dB), gain knob, Play / Cue / Sync, SLIP / QUANT / BRAKE, and a **Pioneer-DJM-style filter knob** (sweep LP from 20 kHz down to 70 Hz on the left half, sweep HP from 20 Hz up to 17 kHz on the right half, magnetic dead-zone at the centre).
- **Crossfader** — four industry-standard curves (Linear / Smooth / Sharp / Hamster), 5 ms per-sample smoothing (no zipper noise), right-click snaps to centre.
- **Sync engine — Mixxx-style phase-lock.** Single-click SYNC = match BPM AND beat phase to master. Right-click SYNC = make THIS deck master. Octave-fold so 175 BPM follower against 87 BPM leader stays at perceived-equal speed (ratio folds to ~1.005).
- **Vinyl scratch on the waveform.** Click + drag the close-up OR overview waveform like a Pioneer-CDJ jog wheel. Newtonian-physics platter integrator with viscous + Coulomb friction. Forward + reverse. Release lets the slipmat catch the platter back to slider rate over τ ≈ 400 ms. Works in single-track mode AND DJ mode with the same physics.
- **Vinyl-spin while paused.** Even when audio is paused or stopped, dragging the waveform spins the platter in the dragged direction. Friction decays the platter back to 0. Like spinning a turntable when the motor is off.
- **Per-deck Pitch ⇄ Stretch toggle.** Disc icon = Pitch (vinyl turntable, pitch + tempo move together via 48-tap sinc resampler). Gauge icon = Stretch (Signalsmith phase-vocoder, pitch stays constant while tempo varies).
- **Per-deck Echo + Gater FX.** Tempo-locked beat-rate chips (1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4 beats). Auto-syncs to deck BPM × pitch ratio in real time.
- **Saved Loops + Smart Cueing.** Per-track named loop slots persisted across sessions. First-time-load auto-creates hot-cue 1 at the detected first downbeat. Quantize-seek snaps hot-cue jumps to the nearest beat.
- **Camelot wheel + harmonic-mix hint (experimental).** Per-deck Camelot key chip derived from a Krumhansl-Schmuckler analysis pass or the file's existing key tag (ID3v2 TKEY etc.), with a colour-coded cross-deck compatibility hint (Match / Relative / Adjacent / EnergyLift / Discord). Treat the suggestions as a starting point — real-world key detection is imperfect across genres and the harmonic-mix logic itself is still being validated against listener feedback. Trust your ears.
- **Dual audio output.** Three modes: single device (DJ Mode runs without cue), dual WASAPI device (Main + Cue on independent endpoints — works with any USB DAC + Bluetooth combo), or ASIO channel-pair (Main on 1+2, Cue on 3+4 of the same multi-out interface). Pre-listen cue mix balance knob.
- **Tracker DJing — unique to FXChainPlayer.** Drop a `.mod` onto Deck A, an MP3 onto Deck B, hit SYNC. The libopenmpt module-tempo engine + offline beat-detector consensus matches Protracker / Fasttracker / Impulse Tracker / 50+ tracker formats against modern dance productions accurately enough to mix demoscene tracks alongside MP3s on the same crossfader. **No other DJ tool can do this.**
- **MIDI controller support.** Hardware-detected mappings for Pioneer DDJ-FLX series, KORG nanoKONTROL2, Akai LPD8, Behringer X-Touch Mini, Mackie-Control, General MIDI. Ableton-style Learn Mode (`Ctrl+Shift+M`) for any other controller. Pitch / EQ / hot-cues / scratch jog-wheel / play / cue / sync / filter all mappable.

> **Beta status.** DJ Mode is feature-complete and stable for production use, but a few rough edges are still being polished — per-channel VST chain audio routing has a small async cache-build delay before plugins become audible (~5-30 sec depending on track length), and a few scratch-ergonomics edge cases are still being refined. The DJ MODE pill in the header carries a small "beta" marker as a signal to calibrate expectations vs the rock-solid single-track player.

## Audio engine

### WASAPI Shared / Exclusive + ASIO 2.3

**WASAPI** Shared and Exclusive modes are the default Audio Mode. The player picks the device's native sample rate — no system-wide resampling. **WASAPI Exclusive** bypasses the Windows audio engine for the bit-for-bit path; works on any USB DAC, built-in sound, or HDMI output, no ASIO driver required.

**ASIO 2.3** is also supported (Steinberg-licensed) for users with a compliant audio interface. Pick **ASIO** in *Settings → Audio → Audio Mode*. Round-trip latency depends on your audio interface and the buffer size the driver supports — see *Settings → Audio → Latency* for the driver's live in/out frame counts and total ms.

- **Output Pair routing** for multi-output interfaces — route the player's stereo to any pair (1-2, 3-4, …) up to the driver's reported total. Persisted across sessions.
- **Configure Driver button** opens the driver's hardware panel directly (e.g. RME TotalMix, MOTU CueMix, Apollo Console, ASIO4ALL settings).
- **Driver-reported latency readout** — in N / out N frames + total ms — refreshed live whenever the driver fires `kAsioLatenciesChanged`.
- **Sample-accurate visual playhead** (since v0.46.1) — the waveform playhead subtracts the backend's currently-queued frames (`IAudioClient::GetCurrentPadding()` on WASAPI, `ASIOGetLatencies()` on ASIO) so what you see is what you hear, not what's been written to the buffer 10-42 ms ago.
- **Output stage** — TPDF dither at canonical ±1 LSB peak (Lipshitz–Vanderkooy 1992) on every integer path, NaN/Inf guards, asymmetric clamps preserving the negative-rail code, full coverage of `ASIOSTInt16/24/32 LSB/MSB` and `Float64MSB`.
- **SEH-safe driver panel calls** + clean reset / latency-change handling so a misbehaving panel can't take out the host.

### Per-Channel VST Chains (since v0.45.0)

For every multi-channel format (tracker `.mod` / `.xm` / `.it` / `.s3m`, SID, NSF, SPC, GBS, every libopenmpt + libgme chip-emulator format), each separable channel can carry its **own dedicated VST3 chain** of up to 16 plugins.

- **Channel-tab navigation** — pick which channel you're editing
- **Per-channel chain editor** — full slot grid with plugin name, vendor, BYPASS pill, MIX slider, EDIT (open VST3 GUI), MOVE-LEFT / MOVE-RIGHT chevrons, REMOVE-X
- **Auto-load presets** — chain configurations are CRC32-keyed (filename + filesize) and auto-loaded on track-change for matching files
- **Manual save / load** — save the per-channel chain layout as a named preset (`%APPDATA%\Akustikrausch\FXChainPlayer\chain_presets\`)
- **Real-time playback** — pre-renders per-channel PCM into a 500 MB-budgeted cache, then routes audio through the per-channel chains live (cache build takes ~5-30 sec on first plugin add)
- **Export-path integration** — multi-track export renders each channel through its own chain to a separate file (filename template `<title> - <channelName>.<ext>`; e.g. `MyTrack - Voice 1.wav`, `Game OST - Square 1.flac`)
- **4 FX modes for export** — Master chain only / Per-channel chains only / Per-channel → master cascade / No FX

### Vinyl Scratch — Newtonian platter physics

Click + drag the waveform like a Pioneer-CDJ jog wheel. The mouse becomes your *fingertip* and applies torque proportional to slip; the platter has **real inertia** (`I = 0.030` ≈ Technics SL-1200GR with felt slipmat) and accelerates / decelerates accordingly.

- **Fully bidirectional** — forward drag = audio plays at drag velocity; backward drag = audio plays in reverse at drag velocity (up to 8 s into the past via a rolling output-history buffer)
- **All techniques emerge from one ODE** — baby / forward / chirp / tear / spinback all from `I·dω/dt = τ_finger − μ_v·(ω − ω_motor) − μ_c·sign(slip)`
- **Inertia-aware release ramp** — τ = `I/μ_v` ≈ 400 ms, calibrated against the SL-1200's 0→33⅓ RPM spin-up
- **Spin while paused** — flick the waveform on a paused track; the platter spins in the dragged direction and friction decays back to 0 (like spinning a turntable with the motor off)
- **Same physics in single-track AND DJ mode** for both the close-up scrolling waveform and the full-song overview strip

### Turntable Pitch Slider (Technics-style)

A vertical pitch fader on the right edge of the expanded waveform AND DJ-mode view. Selectable range (**±8 % / ±16 % / ±50 %**), **0 % center detent** (snaps to neutral within ±0.3 %), **33 ⇄ 45 RPM toggle**, and a per-deck **Pitch ⇄ Stretch toggle** (disc icon = vinyl-style pitch+tempo move together via 48-tap windowed-sinc; gauge icon = Signalsmith phase-vocoder time-stretch with constant pitch).

**At 0 % the slider's fast-path is bit-exact pass-through** — the resampler is bypassed entirely. Auto-resets to neutral on every track change.

### 64-bit double-precision signal path

Internal audio path is `double` end-to-end. Sample-rate conversion (when needed) uses **r8brain-free-src** (linear-phase, ~260 dB SNR per the manufacturer).

### BPM consensus + Camelot key detection

Multi-source BPM aggregator ranks candidates from up to eight signals (manual tap-to-confirm 100, CAF `mark[tmpo]` 99, MIDI Set-Tempo 99, libopenmpt tracker static 99, ID3v2/Vorbis/APEv2/MP4 tag 95, CUE `REM BPM` 95, offline beat-detector 95/80, filename regex 75-95) with octave-fold corroboration boost and contradiction cap. Display tier: ≥95 solid badge, 80-94 dimmed `~XXX` with reduced opacity, <80 hidden — never shows a guess as if verified. Click the BPM pill to verify by tap-along.

**Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection** runs in the background scan thread for every file (8192-pt Hann-windowed FFT chromagram + 24-key Pearson correlation). Persisted in the SQLite cache. Every analysed file gets a Camelot wheel chip in the deck header AND in the playlist's Key column.

### MIDI controller input

RtMidi-6.0-based polling. Mackie-Control + General-MIDI defaults, plus built-in profiles for **KORG nanoKONTROL2**, **Akai LPD8**, **Behringer X-Touch Mini**, **Pioneer DDJ-FLX series**. Hot-plug auto-config matches 16 known controller name fragments. Ableton-style Learn Mode (`Ctrl+Shift+M`) for any other controller. Persistence in `%APPDATA%\Akustikrausch\FXChainPlayer\midi_mappings.json`.

50+ DJ-specific trigger targets mappable: pause / stop / toggle / exitLoop / unsync / tempoLock / pitchRange × 2 decks, hot-cue Set 1-8 × 2 decks, hot-cue Clear 1-8 × 2 decks, scratch start/end + scratch velocity × 2 decks (jog-wheel rotation), filter, echo/gater amount + beats, autoloop halve/double.

### Format Library — every supported format, in-app

A collapsible **Format Info** card in *File Info* (origin, era, codec, decoder library) for every track, and a full **Formats Library** modal panel with a per-category sidebar, search across name / extensions / platform / developer / decoder, and click-to-expand cards with the complete catalogue entry. The redesigned **Settings → File Associations** uses the same source-of-truth.

### 3-Band EQ (built-in modal dialog)

Low Shelf / Mid Bell / High Shelf with two draggable crossover-frequency handles on a live FFT spectrum and three Low/Mid/High gain knobs. RBJ-cookbook biquads with 5-ms coefficient ramping. Soft 0 dB detent on bipolar knobs. Toggle with `Q`.

### Real-time visualization (9 modes)

- **FFT Spectrum** — log-scale frequency analyzer with Hz axis labels (30 / 100 / 300 / 1k / 3k / 10k) and a 1-px peak-hold trail
- **Spectrogram** — scrolling waterfall
- **Stereo Phase Scope** — Lissajous / goniometer with amplitude-brightening
- **VU Meter** — classic PPM L/R
- **LED HiFi** — 32-band segmented display
- **Frequency Landscape** — 3D waterfall with cubic depth fog
- **Pulse Thread** (default since v0.39.0) — multi-octave audio-warped spine with audio-reactive starfield (GPU shader)
- **Chroma Drift** — 6 ribbons at parallax depths riding their own FBM flow fields with audio-driven domain warp + caustic sheen on energy peaks (GPU shader)
- **Studio LED** — smooth HSV-interpolated 3-zone gradient with per-LED diffuser/die SDF + halo bleed (GPU shader)

Plus dedicated **Channel Scopes** (per-channel oscilloscopes for trackers up to 4 channels), a live **ProTracker-style Pattern View** for `.mod` / `.xm` / `.s3m` / `.it` (and now libxmp formats too via the unified `IPatternSource` interface), and the **SID Voices** view for Commodore 64 tunes.

### Studio Compare (A/B)

Dual-decoder synchronized A/B playback — load two files and switch between them sample-accurately with a 64-sample crossfade. Compare masters, codecs, headphones, plugin chains.

### Built-in Bauer-style crossfeed

Smooth your stereo on headphones without a plugin slot. Continuous blend slider, proper gain + delay + lowpass filtering.

### Gapless playback

Next track is pre-loaded and swapped in sample-accurately across the decoder families that allow it (FLAC→MP3, MOD→XM, cross-format — all work).

### Integrated file browser & smart-scan

Point it at your music library. Background SQLite cache for VBR durations, bitrates, cover art, **BPM, Key, Camelot**. Instant playlist building. Breadcrumb navigation, library roots, "Play / Add All" context actions, Favorites tab.

### Export through your VST3 chain

Route **any file or whole playlist** through your VST3 effect chain and render the result to disk. Faster-than-real-time, offline, sample-accurate. Right-click a track in the playlist → **Export to format…** for a single file, or **Ctrl+E** for the full batch dialog.

Output formats:

- **WAV** — 16-bit, 24-bit PCM, 32-bit float
- **MP3** — 128 / 192 / 320 kbps CBR
- **FLAC** — 16-bit and 24-bit lossless (libFLAC, compression level 5)
- **OGG Vorbis** — q3 / q5 / q7 (≈ 112 / 160 / 224 kbps VBR via libvorbis)

Multi-tune containers (NSF / NSFE / SAP, multi-tune SIDs from HVSC, multi-subsong vgmstream archives) can optionally expand into one file per subsong via the **Export all subsongs** checkbox. **Multi-selection** support — Shift-click a range, Ctrl-click individual rows, then export only the selected subset. **Per-row subsong picker** for choosing exactly which tune from a 19-tune SID like `Commando.sid`. **4-mode FX-chain selector** — Master / Per-channel / Both (cascade) / None.

Export is included in every build — no separate "Pro" tier.

### Plugin crash protection

SEH-wrapped plugin process calls, automatic crash journaling, safe-mode after repeated failures, per-`(path, classID)` blacklist so a single crashing plugin in a multi-class shell (e.g. Waves WaveShell with 600+ effects) doesn't take out the rest. Auto-restart watchdog subprocess.

### Code-signed installer + DLLs

Every release is signed via Azure Trusted Signing — both the installer AND every shipped DLL (Qt, libopenmpt, vgmstream, FFmpeg, …) carry a counter-signature. Windows SmartScreen reputation builds quickly. WDAC + AppLocker DLL rules in enterprise environments allow the player without exception.

### Full keyboard accessibility

Every audio control reachable via Tab + Space / Enter / arrow keys. Output-pair, mode chips, device list all wired as standard radio groups. Settings panel, TransportBar, FileBrowser, FxChain bypass, Playlist tabs all wired. Hard CI gate (`qml_a11y_lint`) prevents regressions.

### Performance

Native C++20, lock-free audio thread, GPU-accelerated rendering throughout (no QML Canvas anywhere). Idle RAM ~50 MB, cold startup under 2 s on typical hardware. **81 CTest gates** run on every CI push to lock structural invariants against regression.

## What's new in v0.46.2

This is the **first public release in nine internal release cycles** since v0.37.2 (2026-04-28). It consolidates everything from v0.38.0 → v0.46.2 — a substantial body of new work across DJ Mode, format support, vinyl-scratch physics, per-channel VST chains, MIDI controllers, key detection, GPU visualisers, and a complete code-signing infrastructure. Highlights below grouped by theme rather than by release.

### 🎧 DJ Mode — entirely new (since v0.39.0, polished through v0.46.2)

The biggest single addition since v0.37.2. Press `D` to switch to a dual-deck DJ console with crossfader, hot cues, loops, sync engine, Pioneer-DJM-style filter, Echo + Gater FX, vinyl scratch on the waveform, dual audio output (separate Cue device or ASIO channel-pair), an experimental Camelot wheel + harmonic-mix hint, and full MIDI controller support. Tracker DJing across `.mod` / `.xm` / `.it` / SID + MP3 on the same crossfader is unique to FXChainPlayer.

### 🎚️ Per-Channel VST Chains (since v0.45.0)

Each separable channel of multi-channel formats (trackers, SIDs, NSFs, SPCs, GBSs, …) can carry its own dedicated VST3 chain up to 16 plugins. Real-time playback via 500 MB-budgeted cache. Full export-path integration (4 FX modes: Master / Per-channel / Both cascade / None). CRC32-keyed auto-load presets. **VST3 chain limit lifted from 8 → 16 slots.**

### 🎹 Vinyl Scratch — Newtonian physics (since v0.38.2)

Full ODE-integrator platter physics for click-and-drag waveform scratching. Forward + reverse with bidirectional sinc-interp readback from an 8-second history ring. Pioneer-CDJ feel with Technics SL-1200 inertia + slipmat-friction restore. Works in single-track AND DJ mode on both close-up + overview waveforms. Even works while paused (spin a stopped platter, friction decays it back to 0).

### 📈 Format support — ~800 → 1500+ extensions

**Console emulators added (8):** Atari ST native (`.sndh` / `.ym3-6`), PSF1 audio (PlayStation OST), TFE TFM Music Maker (dual YM2203 OPN-FM), MDX Sharp X68000, Euphony FM-TOWNS, MSX `.kss`, SMS / PC-Engine / RGBDS Game Boy, AHX / HVL Hively Tracker.

**Amiga composer-named players (12 + 6 base):** Hippel COSO/7V, Ben Daglish (Last Ninja / Speedball), David Whittaker, Fred Editor, Ron Klaren, Symphonie 32-voice, Quartet Microdeal, SoundFactory, Mark II, Audio Sculpture, Digital Mugician 7-voice, plus AMOS Music Bank, DeltaMusic, Art Of Noise, JamCracker, SoundFX, BP SoundMon, Sidmon, Sonic Arranger PWM, MaxTrax LucasArts, **TFMX Hülsbeck** (Turrican / Apidya / Monkey Island Amiga), **RJP Bitmap Brothers** (Chaos Engine / Cannon Fodder).

**Demoscene + retro:** TIATracker (Atari 2600), Organya (Cave Story), GoatTracker (C64), SAP (Atari 8-bit), ZxTracker (Vortex Tracker II), MED Advanced (OctaMED MMD0/1/2/3), FutureComposer, Farbrausch V2 (`.v2m` — `.kkrieger` / `.fr-08`), Furnace `.fur` / `.dmf`, IFF SMUS Amiga MIDI-style score.

**DOS Adlib (LGPL-2.1 AdPlug):** ~50 DOS / Sound Blaster / Adlib / OPL2/3 formats — `.imf` / `.hsc` / `.rad` / `.d00` / `.dro` / `.rix` / `.rol` / `.mus`.

**vgmstream r2083 expansion (since v0.46.0):** vgmstream is now DLL-linked + FFmpeg codecs ON by default. Adds **ATRAC3 / ATRAC9** (Sony PSP/PS3/PS4/Vita), **XMA1 / XMA2** (Xbox 360 / Xbox One), **xWMA** (XAudio2 streaming), **FSB-Vorbis / FSB-CELT** (FMOD Sound Bank), **NUS3-Opus** (Switch Smash Bros.), **Speex** (older Bink Audio), **G.719** (Ericsson reference). +12 v0.45.3 newly-documented extensions (`.aea` `.afc` `.afs` `.baa` `.logg` `.sts` `.svs` `.utk` `.xwb` `.xwma`).

**Apple CAF (since v0.38.0):** Dedicated decoder replacing the v0.37.x vgmstream-routed path. Covers PCM 8/16/24/32-bit BE/LE int/float, IMA4, AAC + ALAC via WMF MFTs, FLAC via dr_flac. Surfaces Logic-Pro Apple-Loops BPM tags from `mark[tmpo]+strg` chunks.

**DST-compressed `.dff` (since v0.44.0):** Direct Stream Transfer DSD now plays natively (the patent expired in 2024). Previously this would have required external conversion to raw DSD via foobar2000 + sacd_extract.

**Tracker fallback hardening:** libxmp 4.7.0 added as 9-extension fallback for libopenmpt edge cases (Funktracker `.fnk`, Liquid Tracker `.liq`, Magnetic Fields Packer `.mfp`, AMOS Banks `.abk`, Soundtracker 2.6 `.st26`, Ice Tracker `.ice`, Davey Taylor's `.fmt` variant, AMS, GTK).

**Format Registry centralisation (since v0.43.6):** Single source of truth — every consumer (drag-drop, file browser, favourites, BPM probe, waveform skip, streamable detection) reads from `docs/user/FORMATS.md`. New formats need a single doc edit; the rest cascades automatically.

### 🎛️ MIDI controller input (since v0.38.0)

RtMidi-6.0 polling, hardware-detected mappings (Pioneer DDJ-FLX, KORG nanoKONTROL2, Akai LPD8, Behringer X-Touch Mini, Mackie-Control), Ableton-style Learn Mode (`Ctrl+Shift+M`), 50+ DJ-specific trigger targets including scratch jog-wheel sensors, hot-cue Set/Clear × 8 × 2 decks, filter, Echo/Gater amount + beats. Hot-plug auto-config across 16 known controller name patterns.

### 🎵 BPM consensus + Camelot key (since v0.38.2 / v0.43.7)

Multi-source BPM aggregator (8 sources, octave-fold corroboration), offline Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection (background scan, persisted in SQLite), Camelot wheel chip per track + per deck, cross-deck harmonic-mix compatibility hint (Match / Relative / Adjacent / EnergyLift / Discord) — experimental, treat as a starting point.
### 📊 GPU shader visualisers (since v0.39.0)

Three new GPU visualisers — **Pulse Thread** (now the default, multi-octave audio-warped spine with audio-reactive starfield), **Chroma Drift** (6 ribbons at parallax depths riding FBM flow fields), **Studio LED** (smooth HSV-interpolated gradient with per-LED diffuser/die SDF). All three use `QSGTextureProvider` with proper lifecycle (60-Hz heartbeat, `itemChange(ItemSceneChange)` rebuild on DPI shift, no UAF on window-teardown).

### 🔊 Sample-accurate visual playhead sync (since v0.46.1)

The waveform playhead now subtracts the backend's currently-queued frames so the visible position matches what's actually being heard at the speakers — not what was written to the buffer 10-42 ms ago. WASAPI uses `IAudioClient::GetCurrentPadding()` per call; ASIO uses the cached `ASIOGetLatencies()`.

### 💪 Stability + bug fixes

- **Mid-track playback recovery (v0.43.6)** — single transient `read()=0` from dr_mp3 on bad MP3 frames no longer triggers a track-skip; 5×20ms retry budget recovers via the same retry pattern as the legacy DecoderThread.
- **AudioDecoder move-ops field-leak (v0.43.4)** — 7-month-old class of "format opens but plays silence after gapless transition" reports closed via the `check_decoder_move_ops` CTest gate scanning all 69 unique_ptr + 4 scalar fields across both move-ops.
- **Concurrency hardening (v0.43.3)** — `taglib_lock.h` + `libopenmpt_lock.h` + `iff8svx_lock.h` + `mf_lock.h` Meyers-singletons serialise format-CREATE across 5 racing threads (audio decoder + WaveformProvider + SmartScan worker + BpmDetector + KeyDetector). Closes a recurring bulk-add crash class.
- **TFMX + RJP rendering bug fixes (v0.46.0)** — clamp-not-mask in note dispatch (was folding high-transpose into wrong octaves on Hülsbeck files); DMAOn loop heuristic 256 → 8192 bytes (was killing Monkey choir + Turrican III orchestral hits as one-shot decay); RJP `currentInstrument = 1` default (every Bitmap-Brothers RDAT was producing peak=0.00 silence on bare-NOTE patterns).
- **DJ HP filter (v0.46.2)** — Cytomic-SVF canonical HP output formula corrected from buggy `v3 - k*v1 - v2` to canonical `in - k*v1 - v2`. Pre-fix the extra `-s2` term built up DC drift as the LP integrator state grew under real signal input.
- **Reverse-scratch first-25-samples-silence eliminated (v0.46.2)** — cursor primes at `writePos - sinc::kTapsHalf - 1` instead of `writePos`, so sample 0's kernel fits entirely inside the valid window. Single-track AND DJ-mode benefit equally.
- **Code signing for `.dll`s (v0.46.0)** — release.yml signing-filter expanded from `exe` to `dll,exe`. Critical for enterprise WDAC + AppLocker DLL-rule deployments.
- **DJ-Mode audio dropout root-cause kill (v0.43.7 build-fix #8)** — tracker EOF mid-track was silently flipping `playing.store(false)` in the per-deck worker loop with NO log line + NO recovery. Now auto-loops in DJ context (DJ context = "loop this track until I tell you otherwise") + every transition is logged.

### 🧪 Internal QA infrastructure

The CTest gate count grew from a handful in v0.37.2 to **81 active gates** in v0.46.2 — every fix-class lands with its own anti-regression gate. The full `dist/` ships with `check_decoder_move_ops` PASS, `check_dj_layout_invariants` PASS, `qml_boolean_wraps` PASS, `concurrency_invariants` PASS, plus 77 others — drift in ANY of them fails the CI build.

### Auto-update

FXChainPlayer checks GitHub Releases for new versions and offers one-click install with SHA-256 verification. Toggle in *Settings → Updates*.

---

## System Requirements

- **Windows 10** or **Windows 11**, 64-bit
- ~100 MB disk space
- An audio output device (WASAPI — any built-in sound, USB DAC, or HDMI audio works; ASIO 2.3 supported on any compliant interface)
- Optionally: a VST3 plugin folder with your favorite effects

---

## Supported plugins

FXChainPlayer is a **VST3 host** (not VST2). Any 64-bit VST3 effect plugin should work.

There is no compatibility list, no certification, no allowlist. Any well-behaved 64-bit VST3 effect should load. Tested heavily with **FabFilter**, **Waves**, **iZotope**, **Sonarworks**, **Tokyo Dawn Labs**, **Valhalla DSP**, **Acon Digital**, **Softube**, **Kirchhoff-EQ**, **Pro-MB**, **Dear Reality dearVR**, **Beyerdynamic Headphone Lab** and many others. Multi-class plugin shells (e.g. Waves WaveShell with 600+ effects) are crash-isolated per `(path, classID)` so a single misbehaving effect can't take out the rest.

Instruments (VSTi) are filtered out automatically — FXChainPlayer is a playback tool, not a DAW.
